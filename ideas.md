  **Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalism / Industrial Tech
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw Functionality**: Emphasize the "machine" aspect of vending. Exposed grids, monospaced fonts, and high contrast.
  2. **Data-First**: Information density is a feature, not a bug. Dashboards should look like mission control centers.
  3. **Tactile Feedback**: Buttons and interactions should feel "heavy" and mechanical, like pressing a physical button on a vending machine.
  4. **Transparency**: Use semi-transparent layers and glassmorphism to show depth, but with sharp edges, not rounded ones.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Electric Blue (#0055FF) and Safety Orange (#FF5500) for alerts/actions.
  - **Background**: Deep Slate (#0F172A) or Stark White (#FFFFFF) with high contrast borders.
  - **Intent**: Evoke the feeling of precision engineering and industrial reliability.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular Grid**: Strict bento-box style layout. Every element lives in a clearly defined cell.
  - **Asymmetry**: Use oversized typography to break the grid occasionally.
  - **Sidebar Navigation**: A persistent, tool-like sidebar that resembles a physical control panel.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Barcode/QR Motifs**: Use decorative barcode patterns as dividers or backgrounds.
  - **Terminal-style Headers**: Section headers that look like command-line prompts (`> SYSTEM_STATUS`).
  - **Hard Shadows**: Elements have solid, non-blurred shadows to create a "cut-out" look.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Instant Response**: Hover states should be immediate and sharp (color inversion).
  - **Click Clack**: Visual feedback that mimics the mechanical latching of a vending coil.

  **Animation**:
  - **Glitch/Slide**: Transitions should be snappy, sliding in from cardinal directions. No soft fades.
  - **Typing Effects**: Text reveals as if being printed on a receipt or terminal.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **JetBrains Mono** or **Space Mono** (Monospaced, technical).
  - **Body**: **Inter** or **Roboto** (Clean, legible sans-serif for density).
  - **Hierarchy**: Uppercase for labels, sentence case for content.

  **Design Movement**: Glassmorphism / Ethereal Fintech
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Fluidity**: The interface should feel like a continuous flow of data. Soft gradients and rounded corners.
  2. **Trust & Security**: Use a palette that screams "secure financial system" but modern.
  3. **Light & Depth**: Heavy use of backdrop blur, inner shadows, and lighting effects to create a 3D glass feel.
  4. **Minimalism**: Hide complexity until needed. Clean surfaces with high-value data popping out.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Gradient from Cyan (#06B6D4) to Violet (#8B5CF6).
  - **Background**: Dark mode default. Deep Navy (#0B1120) with glowing orbs in the background.
  - **Intent**: To make the complex logistics of vending management feel effortless and magical.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Floating Cards**: Content floats on glass cards above a dynamic background.
  - **Centralized Focus**: Key metrics take center stage with ample breathing room.
  - **Soft Grid**: Layouts are flexible and responsive, not rigid.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Frosted Glass**: Navigation and cards have a `backdrop-filter: blur()`.
  - **Glowing Borders**: Active elements have a subtle gradient glow.
  - **Mesh Gradients**: Backgrounds use slow-moving mesh gradients.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Hover Lift**: Cards gently lift and glow when interacted with.
  - **Smooth Flow**: Transitions are liquid and eased.

  **Animation**:
  - **Parallax**: Background elements move slower than foreground content.
  - **Fade & Scale**: Elements enter with a soft fade and slight scale up.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Plus Jakarta Sans** (Geometric, modern, friendly).
  - **Body**: **DM Sans** (Clean, highly readable).
  - **Hierarchy**: Heavy use of font weight to distinguish hierarchy rather than size.

  **Design Movement**: Swiss Style / International Typographic Style
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Order & Clarity**: Mathematical grids are holy. Content is king.
  2. **Objective Photography**: Use high-quality, unadorned photography of machines and products.
  3. **Asymmetry**: Dynamic asymmetrical layouts that guide the eye.
  4. **Typography as Image**: Large, bold typography is the primary decorative element.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Swiss Red (#FF0000) or International Orange (#FF4F00).
  - **Background**: Off-White (#F5F5F5) or Light Grey (#E5E5E5).
  - **Intent**: To present the system as a professional, enterprise-grade solution. Clean, efficient, timeless.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Golden Ratio**: Layouts follow classical proportions.
  - **Whitespace**: Massive amounts of negative space to frame content.
  - **Typographic Grid**: Text aligns perfectly to a baseline grid.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Thick Rules**: Heavy horizontal or vertical lines to separate sections.
  - **Oversized Numbers**: Key metrics are displayed in massive font sizes.
  - **Geometric Shapes**: Simple circles or squares used for iconography or emphasis.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Snap**: Scrolling snaps to sections.
  - **Precise**: Interactions are subtle but precise. No unnecessary flair.

  **Animation**:
  - **Masking**: Images and text reveal from behind masks.
  - **Kinetic Type**: Typography moves and adjusts based on scroll or interaction.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Helvetica Now Display** or **Neue Haas Grotesk** (The classic).
  - **Body**: **Helvetica Now Text** or **Arial** (Universal, neutral).
  - **Hierarchy**: Strict size hierarchy.
